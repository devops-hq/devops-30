# DevOps Roadmap: Part III - The Future is Now (Advanced Projects)

This advanced stage of the roadmap is designed for experienced practitioners seeking to master the most complex, high-value, and forward-looking paradigms in DevOps. These projects focus on the strategic skills required for senior, lead, and architect-level roles.

**Objective:** Design and build the automated, intelligent platforms of the future.

The projects move beyond consuming services to designing and building the automated, intelligent platforms that will power the next generation of software delivery, with a strong focus on Platform Engineering, AIOps, MLOps, and enterprise-grade resilience.
