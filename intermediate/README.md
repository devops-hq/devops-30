# DevOps Roadmap: Part II - Scaling and Securing (Intermediate Projects)

This section of the roadmap transitions from proficiency with individual tools to mastering integrated, real-world systems. The projects are designed to build upon the foundational skills acquired in Part I, preparing you for more senior roles.

**Objective:** Build integrated systems that are robust, secure, and scalable.

The focus here is on creating production-ready solutions that address the dominant industry trends for 2025, including DevSecOps, GitOps, and advanced cloud architecture.
